<!--
  How old a stream is and the button that makes it new, as one small control.

  It used to be a strip pinned across the window under the top nav, which cost
  the grid below it a band of its own and said things at a length that band
  invited: "Subscriptions feed last updated: 27 minutes ago". The age is the
  only part anyone reads, so that is all it says now — "Fresh", "27 minutes
  ago" — and the sentence it used to be survives as the button group's tooltip,
  where a reader who wants to know which feed is meant can still find out.

  It goes in a row the page already has, the same rule the density switch
  follows: no page grows a band of chrome to hold a control this small. The
  button leads and the age follows it, so that the button sits at a fixed
  distance from whatever is before it in the row — with the age first, every
  tick of the clock that changed its width moved the button.
