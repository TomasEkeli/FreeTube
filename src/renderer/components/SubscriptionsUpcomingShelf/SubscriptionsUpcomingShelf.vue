  What has not happened yet, kept out of what has.

  A premiere is dated by the day it will air, so a stream sorted by date opened
  with things nobody could watch — the future wearing the newest upload's
  clothes. The fix is not to hide it: something scheduled for Friday is worth
  knowing about, and often more worth knowing about than another Tuesday upload.
  It is to stop pretending it is news. So it lives up here, in its own order,
  read as a schedule rather than as history: soonest first, because that is the
  next thing to happen, whereas the stream below runs newest first because that
  is the latest thing that did.

  The same cards, the same grid, the same density as the stream below — the
  shelf follows the reader's layout choices exactly as every other surface
  does, rather than imposing a layout of its own. What sets it apart is the
  frame: the tint, the header, and the count, not a different shape of card.
  (It briefly forced a full-width list on the theory that a schedule is a
  column; on screen that read as the shelf ignoring the density switch.)

  Folded away it is one line with a count on it, which is the whole shelf for a
  reader who does not care — and the count is still there, so caring again costs
  one click. Whether it is folded is remembered, because it is a standing
  preference and not a mood.
