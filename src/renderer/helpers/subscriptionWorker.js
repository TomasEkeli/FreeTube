/**
 * One manager for every subscription request.
 *
 * Refreshing a feed, recovering the channels a refresh could not reach and
 * filling in the details RSS leaves out are three different jobs that all talk
 * to the same host, and they must not decide independently how hard to push it:
 * three polite trickles are one burst, which is the thing being avoided. So
 * there is one manager, one shared budget, and lanes served in priority order.
 *
 * The budget is a sliding window: at most `SUBSCRIPTION_BUDGET` requests may
 * start in any `SUBSCRIPTION_BUDGET_WINDOW_MS`, and at most that many may be in
 * flight at once. That is deliberately the same traffic shape as the batching it
 * replaces — fifty channels, then a two second pause — with the difference that
 * it composes: three feeds refreshing at once and the back-fill running
 * underneath them cannot together exceed what one feed used to do alone.
 *
 * Lanes each have a width, which is how much of the budget they may occupy at
 * once, and a minimum gap between their own requests. Refresh may take the whole
 * budget; recovery stays at one request at a time because it only runs when
 * something has already refused us; enrichment keeps a narrow width so it fills
 * the slack a refresh leaves rather than competing with it.
 *
 * The queues hold closures, so they stay out of the store; only the progress the
 * interface needs is reactive. It all lives at module scope rather than in a
 * component so that switching tabs, or navigating away entirely, does not
 * abandon work that takes minutes to finish.
