 * Decide what a claim that a channel is gone actually means.
 *
 * Two separate problems are solved here, both found when YouTube's RSS service
 * began answering 404 for every valid id on 2026-08-22.
 *
 * The first is that the claim used to be believed outright. A 404 on the RSS
 * playlist feed was checked against the RSS channel feed, which is the same
 * service, so the check agreed with it whenever the service was the thing at
 * fault. `corroborate` asks something independent instead, and an unconfirmed
 * claim now means `FETCH_FAILED`: retryable, and the cache left alone. Refusing
 * to condemn a channel costs a retry later, while condemning it wrongly caches
 * emptiness over a feed that was fine and marks it not worth retrying, so the
 * two errors are not equally bad and this leans the safe way deliberately.
 *
 * The second is that no amount of individually reasonable verdicts should add up
 * to "your entire subscription list was terminated". Past the anomaly limit the
 * guard stops believing any of them, and stops probing: during an outage the
 * corroboration would otherwise be several hundred extra requests fired at a
 * host that is already refusing everything.
 *
 * @param {string} feed
 * @param {{ id: string, name?: string }} channel
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {string} options.source what claimed the channel is gone, for the trace
 * @param {boolean} [options.authoritative] set when the claim came from an
 *   endpoint that reports termination explicitly rather than by absence, which
 *   needs no second opinion. Still counted against the anomaly limit, because a
 *   flood of explicit terminations is no more believable than a flood of 404s.
 * @param {() => Promise<'gone' | 'alive' | 'unknown'>} [options.corroborate]
