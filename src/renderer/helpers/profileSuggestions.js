/**
 * Profile suggestions: where the channels on the Channels page might belong,
 * worked out from what the app has already seen of them and nothing else.
 *
 * Two things are remembered as the app goes, at no cost in requests: the
 * YouTube category of every video watched, on its history entry, and the tags
 * of every subscribed channel whose page passes through, on its subscription
 * cache record. This module turns those into suggestions.
 *
 * Like `channelsOverview`, it touches no store, no i18n and no router, so the
 * rules can be checked from node, in `_scripts/checkProfileSuggestions.mjs`.
 *
 * How a suggestion is arrived at, in order, each step seeing only the
 * Unassigned channels the steps before it left:
 *
 * 1. Every subscribed channel in no profile (the pool) or in exactly one is
 *    considered. One in two or more is the duplicates UI's to settle.
 * 2. Each profile's character is worked out from its own members. A pool
 *    channel that fits one well enough is suggested for it; a channel in a
 *    profile that fits another clearly better is a suggested move.
 * 3. A pool channel tagged with a profile's name is suggested for it.
 * 4. The rest with a category are grouped by it, and a group named as a
 *    profile is is suggested for that profile.
 * 5. A channel tagged with a category group's name joins that group.
 * 6. What is left is grouped by the tags most of it shares.
 *
 * Anything left over stays in the pool.
