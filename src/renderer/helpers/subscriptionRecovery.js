/**
 * Going back for the channels a refresh could not reach.
 *
 * A refresh asks for every channel at once. When that goes badly it can go
 * badly for hundreds of them, and the repair by hand is: refresh again, then
 * switch to each profile in turn and refresh those, and failing that open every
 * channel one at a time. This is that, without the hand.
 *
 * The escalation is in how much is asked for at once. The refresh itself is
 * batches of fifty. Then profiles, in batches of at most twenty five. Then one
 * channel at a time. Each step asks for less than the one before, on the theory
 * that a refusal is a reaction to how much is being asked for.
 *
 * Only channels that failed in a way worth retrying are carried forward, so a
 * channel that is simply gone never sets any of this off, and each step carries
 * only what the step before it could not get.
 *
 * It runs on the shared worker, so it cannot overlap with itself or with the
 * detail back-fill, and it never touches the loading state: the feed shows what
 * the refresh did manage, and grows as the rest arrives.

/**
 * Passed as the retry count so that a fetch reports its failure rather than
 * working through its ladder of fallbacks.
 *
 * Those ladders exist for one channel having a bad day, and are actively
 * harmful here: eight genuinely failing channels once turned into forty two
 * requests. Sending more requests because requests are being refused is the
 * wrong instinct, and this is the situation where it matters most. Any value
 * past the end of a ladder's cases will do.
