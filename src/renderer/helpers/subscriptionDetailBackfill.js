/**
 * Filling in the details RSS leaves out, for the part of the feed being looked
 * at.
 *
 * RSS carries no duration, so a feed built from it shows no duration badge. The
 * only source is the channel's own page, which is the very thing being avoided
 * when falling back to RSS, so this asks as little as it can: only the channels
 * contributing to what is on screen, in feed order from the top, one at a time
 * on the shared worker.
 *
 * One channel request covers every entry that channel contributes, which is why
 * this works per channel rather than per video. The result is written through to
 * the cache and carried across refreshes, so a channel is asked once and stays
 * filled in.
 *
 * If the channel page is blocked too then nothing happens and nothing is lost:
 * the feed keeps the RSS data it already had. That is the bargain of doing this
 * in the background.
 *
 * Live streams want this more than videos do. Their RSS entries have no live
 * flag either, so a stream happening right now is indistinguishable from an
 * ordinary video until somebody asks the channel. Shorts are excluded because
 * no duration exists for them anywhere: the parsers write an empty one whatever
 * the source.
