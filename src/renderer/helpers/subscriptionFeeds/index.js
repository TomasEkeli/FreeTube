/**
 * Every subscription feed, and what each one needs to be fetched and shown.
 *
 * The four tab components were copies of each other: the same state, the same
 * cache-or-remote decision, the same batching, the same progress bar handling,
 * differing only in which store keys and fetch functions they named. The
 * composable took the shared behaviour; this takes what genuinely differs.
 *
 * The tabs are gone now — one stream shows every kind at once — and what is
 * left of a feed is exactly this: where its entries are cached, how they are
 * fetched, and how they are filtered before assembly.
 *
 * @typedef {object} SubscriptionFeedDescriptor
 * @property {string} feed identifier used for tracing, caching and error collection
 * @property {string} cacheGetter store getter holding this feed's cache
 * @property {string} updateAction store action that writes one channel's entries
 * @property {'videos' | 'posts'} entriesKey field name inside a cache entry
 * @property {'setting' | 'always' | 'never'} rssMode where RSS use is decided.
 *   `never` is not a preference but a fact about what YouTube publishes: with
 *   no RSS to read there is nothing lighter to read, whatever the setting says.
 * @property {boolean} followsDetailBackfill whether this feed's entries can be
 *   filled in in the background, and so needs rebuilding when they are
 * @property {string} shownGetter store getter holding this feed's chip: whether
 *   the reader has it switched on. Only ever about what is shown. What is
 *   fetched is a separate question with a separate answer: every feed, every
 *   time.
 * @property {string} shownAction store action the chip writes through
 * @property {(() => boolean) | undefined} isHiddenAppWide whether a setting
 *   outside this page hides this kind everywhere. It overrules the chip, and
 *   the chip is not offered while it holds — there is no sense in a control
 *   that cannot do anything. Only live has one.
 * @property {(channel: object, context: { useRss: boolean, failedAttempts?: number }) => Promise<{
 *   status: string, entries: any[] | null, name?: string, thumbnailUrl?: string
