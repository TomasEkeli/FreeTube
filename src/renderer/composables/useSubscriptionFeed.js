 * the four feeds have now been merged for the same sort of reason, one level up.
 * Four tabs meant the reader had to know which kind a thing was before they
 * could look for it, and had to visit four places to find out what had happened
 * since yesterday. There is one thing to read, so there is one list.
 *
 * What is still per kind is fetching, caching and the per-kind filters, and all
 * of that is left where it is: each feed's `postProcess` runs over its own
 * entries, and the merge only does the part that needs every kind at once —
 * one sort field, newest first. The per-channel cap keeps working because it
 * still sees a list; that it now counts across kinds rather than within one is
 * a detail nobody using it would notice.
 *
 * The cache remains the record of what has been fetched, each feed's revision
 * says when that record changed, and this rebuilds the stream from the cache
 * whenever any of them does — so a refresh that finishes while this page is
 * elsewhere is picked up whenever it comes back.
