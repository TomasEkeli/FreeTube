/**
 * The subscriptions page: one stream, not four tabs.
 *
 * The strip is gone, and with it the question it kept asking. Choosing between
 * videos, shorts, live streams and posts was never a thing anyone wanted to do;
 * it was a thing they had to do four times to find out what had happened since
 * yesterday, and choosing wrongly hid the answer. So the four lists are one
 * list, in one order, and over it a row of chips saying which kinds are in it.
 *
 * A chip is not a tab. A tab asked which one kind to look at; a chip says
 * whether this kind belongs in what is being read, and the reader may have all
 * four or none. And a chip is only ever about what is shown: every kind is
 * fetched every refresh whatever the chips say, so switching one on reveals
 * something as current as the rest of the stream, out of the cache, without a
 * request and without a spinner.
 *
 * The row is the page's one control row: the chips at one end and the density
 * switch at the other, since a second row of controls over a single stream is
 * the sort of thing this page was rebuilt to be rid of.
 *
 * Between that row and the stream sits the shelf of what has not happened yet,
 * which is the other half of making one list readable: a premiere is dated by
 * the day it will air, so leaving it in the stream put the future at the top of
 * a list of the past. The shelf is a schedule and the stream is history, and
 * neither has to be read as the other.
