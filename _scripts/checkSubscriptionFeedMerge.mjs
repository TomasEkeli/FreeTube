/**
 * Checks the rules for assembling the four subscription feeds into one stream.
 *
 * The merge is the one place where the kinds meet, and it fails quietly: a post
 * that sorts to the bottom of the stream because its time was read from the
 * wrong field looks exactly like a channel that has not posted lately, and a
 * live stream listed twice looks like the channel uploaded it twice. Nothing
 * throws. So the rules are asserted here.
 *
 * Run with `pnpm run check-subscription-feed-merge`. There is no test runner in
 * this project, which is why this is a script.
