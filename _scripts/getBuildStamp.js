 * Identifies which build you are actually running.
 *
 * Every build of a given version otherwise looks identical, so a locally built
 * release cannot be told from the one before it, and "does this build have that
 * fix in it" has no answer. That is the question this exists to answer.
 *
 * The count is commits since the version in package.json was set, rather than a
 * date, because several builds of the same version commonly happen on one day
 * and a date cannot order them. It rises by one per commit and resets when the
 * version is bumped, so it reads as a build number within that version.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the version string. The update check parses the
 * version numerically, and the release workflow rewrites it in place and then
 * relies on the resulting artefact filenames, so anything appended to it has to
 * survive both.
